# Adding Authentication

Like the User Interface Gateway, a web application backend is a boundary between the public side of the observatory software system and the authenticated, protected
control system. Because of this, a web application developer must be conscious of and support the authentication and authorization
of its users according to the observatory security approach.  

It's okay to have unprotected routes that are read-only and cannot cause any changes, but any route that 
can change the control system must be protected with the correct level of authorization. This flow describes how to
integrate authentication and authorization through the use of CSW AAS Service.

## Add a Protected Route in Backend

To demonstrate authorization, we will need to create a "protected" route, that is, an endpoint that requires a
valid authorization token to access.

### Add new route with protection

We will add a new route to our server which is protected. To access this route, the request should 
contain a token containing the role `esw-user`.  We have set up some 
[sample users](https://tmtsoftware.github.io/csw/apps/cswservices.html#predefined-users-) when we start 
`csw-services` with the Authentication and Authorization Service enabled, and we will use one of these users for our
tutorial.

@@@ note
In the text above, `esw-user` is not a login or individual name; it is a role in the AAS security model. During operations, AAS will be
configured to give individuals or logins specific roles. For now, we have created a few logins that have the same role
as their login names.
@@@

Add the route code below to `SampleRoute.scala` from the basic flow.  Note the route requires the user to have the `esw-user` role to
access the endpoint.

If you deleted the tilde (~) at the end of your route in the last tutorial, be sure to put it back,
and then append the following:

Scala
: @@snip [SampleRoute.scala](../../../../backend/src/main/scala/org/tmt/sample/http/SampleRoute.scala) { #add-secured-route }

## Consume a Protected Route in the Frontend

Now, we will create a component in our frontend UI that uses our protected route.

### Add secured Post

Add the following method in `api.ts`, which sends a request to our `/securedRaValues` backend route.

Typescript
: @@snip [api.ts](../../../../frontend/src/utils/api.ts) { #secured-fetch-data }

Note that this method requires an AAS authorization token, which is then passed to the server with the request.

### Create a React component to consume our secured route

In the `pages` folder, create a file named `SecuredRaDecInput.tsx`.  Then create a `SecuredRaDecInput` React component
with the following form.

Typescript
: @@snip [SecuredRaDecInput.tsx](../../../../frontend/src/components/pages/SecuredRaDecInput.tsx) { #add-component }

### Use secured Post in our component

Again, a reference to the Location Service is obtained via a context named `LocationServiceProvider`.
Since this component requires authorization, we use another context to get a reference to the authorization system.

Add the following as first lines inside the `SecuredRaDecInput` component.

Typescript
: @@snip [SecuredRaDecInput.tsx](../../../../frontend/src/components/pages/SecuredRaDecInput.tsx) { #use-location-service-from-context }

The `useAuth` method is a hook provided in `hooks/useAuth.tsx` that accesses the context.  Like `LocationServiceProvider`,
the `AuthContextProvider` context is made available to the component during construction in `App.tsx`.

Now, add an `onFinish` handler above the return statement, similar to our non-secured component.  Note that this time we will obtain the token from the 
authorization context and pass that to our API method.

Typescript
: @@snip [SecuredRaDecInput.tsx](../../../../frontend/src/components/pages/SecuredRaDecInput.tsx) { #use-fetch }

Don't forget to add the necessary imports!

### Connect our new component

Next, we will add the protected route in `Routes.tsx` within the `<Switch>` block, before the catch-all `*` route.

Typescript
: @@snip [Routes.tsx](../../../../frontend/src/routes/Routes.tsx) { #add-protected-route }

Add an action for our new route in `MenuBar.tsx` below the previously added RaDec `Menu.Item`

Typescript
: @@snip [MenuBar.tsx](../../../../frontend/src/components/menu/MenuBar.tsx) { #add-protected-route-action }

### Add Login & Logout functionality

To get the authorization token the user needs to log in. To provide login and logout capabilities, we will make 
use of the generated `Login` and `Logout` components.

Add menu item actions for logging in and logging out in `MenuBar.tsx` below the previously added SecuredRaDec `Menu.Item`
The menu item will change depending on whether the user is logged in or not to show protected functionality.

Typescript
: @@snip [MenuBar.tsx](../../../../frontend/src/components/menu/MenuBar.tsx) { #add-login-logout }

Note the authorization hook is used again here to get a handle to the authorization store.

Typescript
: @@snip [MenuBar.tsx](../../../../frontend/src/components/menu/MenuBar.tsx) { #use-auth-hook }

## Try It Out!

Compile the backend and restart it.  Then run the UI as before and try it out.

Notice the menu bar shows a "Login" item, since we haven't logged in

![Menu Bar with Login](webAppMenuLogin.png)

Clicking on the "Login" (or "SecuredRaDec") menu item will take you to the login page. 
Be sure to log in with the`esw-user1` user with the password `esw-user1`.  

You may note the "Login" menu item has changed to "Logout".

Once logged in, you will be able to use the SecuredRaDec form.  The behavior is the same as the non-secured version, 
but it gives you the idea of how pages and routes can be protected. 




**Nice Work!**
